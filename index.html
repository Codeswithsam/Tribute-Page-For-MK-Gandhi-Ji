<p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, also known as Mahatma Gandhi, was an Indian independence activist who was a pioneer of nonviolent resistance. He was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, and died on January 30, 1948, in New Delhi, India. Gandhi is known for his philosophy of nonviolent resistance, which he called Satyagraha, and for leading India to independence from British rule in 1947.</p>

      <p>Gandhi was born in Porbandar, a coastal town in present-day Gujarat, India. His father, Karamchand Gandhi, was a diwan (chief minister) of Porbandar, and his mother, Putlibai, was a devout Hindu. Gandhi was the youngest of four children and was a shy and introverted child.</p>
